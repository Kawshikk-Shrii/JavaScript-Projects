                        A friendly neighborhood superhero who was just minding his own business until a spider said “nah bro, you’re special.”
Now he swings between buildings, fights villains with serious anger issues, cracks jokes in life-threatening situations, and still struggles to pay rent.
Powers include wall-climbing, spider-sense, web-slinging… and maximum procrastination when homework is due.
