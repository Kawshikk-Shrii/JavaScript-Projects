A sleek and modern **Digital Clock Web Application** built using **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that displays real-time updates with a persistent **Light/Dark theme toggle**.

This project demonstrates how JavaScript interacts with time-based functions, updates the UI dynamically every second, and preserves user preferences using **localStorage** — a core concept used in production applications.

## 🌟 Why This Project Is Valuable

At first glance, a digital clock may seem simple — but it teaches some of the **most essential frontend engineering concepts**, including:

👉 Real-time UI updates  
👉 Time-based JavaScript execution  
👉 State persistence  
👉 Theme switching  
👉 Clean UI transitions  

Projects like this help you transition from writing scripts to **building real applications**.

## 🎯 Core Features

### ⌛ Real-Time Clock
- Displays accurate hours, minutes, and seconds  
- Updates automatically every second  
- Converts 24-hour format into **12-hour format**  
- Shows **AM / PM** indicator  

⚡ Powered by JavaScript's `Date()` object and `setInterval()`.

---

### 🌗 Persistent Light / Dark Mode

A modern UI must respect user preferences — and this project does exactly that.

✔ Toggle between light and dark themes  
✔ Smooth background transitions  
✔ Automatically remembers the selected theme  
✔ Loads saved preference on refresh  

This mimics behavior found in professional applications like YouTube and GitHub.

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated

Mastering these puts you ahead of most beginners:

- **Date & Time API** – Working with real-world time data  
- **setInterval()** – Running scheduled updates  
- **DOM Manipulation** – Updating elements dynamically  
- **Event Handling** – Responding to user interaction  
- **Class Toggling** – Managing UI states  
- **localStorage** – Persisting user preferences  
- **Template Literals** – Cleaner string formatting  

👉 These are foundational skills for frameworks like **React**.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. JavaScript fetches the current system time.
2. The time is formatted into a readable 12-hour structure.
3. The UI updates every second without page reload.
4. Users can toggle between light and dark themes.
5. The selected theme is saved in **localStorage**.
6. When the page reloads — the preference is restored automatically.

This reflects how modern apps remember user settings.
